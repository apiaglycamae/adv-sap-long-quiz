## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
- It is a technology that helps the developer build software using common interface standards and patterns, allowing them to be quickly integrated into new applications to promote reusability to ensure that the requirements are met.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
- The first characteristic of SOA is the Standardized Service contract whose goal is to promote and express the features of their services, Next is the Loose Coupling which can minimize the dependencies between services, Next is Abstraction this characteristic is about hiding their details from the outside world, Service Reusability it contains services that can be reused  in the future, Autonomy this service should self-contain or independent about other services, Statelessness is about minimizing the service to enhance the performance and scalability of a service, Discoverability it provide explicable information about their capabilities, Composability services that can be reused in multiple solutions and lastly is Interoperability is about sharing data in other services.

3. Define Microservices.
- Microservices is about dividing large services into smaller services and each part has its own responsibility.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
- Microservices allow organizations to create small, cross-functional teams for agile operations, increasing agility that a single feature team can build, test, and deploy it. 

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
- The difference between SOA and Microservices is that the SOA service is reusable and shared in enterprises, while microservices is their services for individual that function independently. Their similarities is both Microservices and service-oriented architecture (SOA) enable development teams to create, implement, and maintain new cloud applications with efficiency. 

6. Define Web Services.
- Web services is about communication between two devices for exchanging data.

7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.
- The first benefit of using Web services is Exposing the Existing Functions on the network that manage code and functionality of a program, Interoperability allows applications to exchange information and services, and the standardized protocol is a protocol for communications between four layers, and low-cost communication that you can use for implementing web services using low-cost internet.

8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.
- Xml-based provides inter-component communication, Loosely coupled is a client web service that does not fix to web services directly, Coarse-Grained is a service for returning more data, Ability to be synchronous or asynchronous in synchronous requires parties for execution while asynchronous does not need any component in communication, support remote procedure calls is a program that machine have service machine, support document exchange about exchanging information between different system.

9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.
- Provider provides web services, requestor the client application that requires web services, broker provides the access in finding web services, publish used broker so that the services request can find the services, find it will help the broker to find the web services, bind its all about combining all the information that broker gain.

10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.
- In SOAP you can transmit messages in any way as long as both client and server use the same method, WSDL used to describe web interface, UDDI to find information about web services and it used for businesses to partners of their business.
